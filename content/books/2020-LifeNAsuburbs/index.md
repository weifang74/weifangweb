  Until the middle of the 20th century, the social ecologies of metropolitan America could be conceptualized accurately by the textbook models of Alonso (1964), Burgess (1925), and Hoyt (1939) in terms of processes of congregation, segregation, bid-rent, and sequent occupancy – all of which pivoted tightly around a dominant central business district and transportation hub. Since the middle decades of the 20th century, however, remarkable changes have transformed metropolitan America. In spite of these considerable changes, only passing attention has been given to how these changes have been transcribed into the settlement patterns of cities and metropolitan areas. Have the stereotypical patterns of the Chicago School and of Murdie’s famous model (1969) shown signs of giving way to a more complex social spatial structure? Or should Los Angeles be considered the paradigmatic postmodern American city? All these questions remind us to reevaluate the contemporary importance of traditional theories and to test our long-standing ideas about how cities grow and change.
  
  In this chapter, a set of cluster analysis and GIS-based spatial analyses have been developed to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of neighbourhood change in the North Carolina Piedmont region based on an analysis of decennial census tract data between 1980 and 2010. This chapter focuses on (1) the spatial patterns of neighbourhood distribution; (2) neighbourhood transformation over the past three decades; and (3) the spatial patterns of neighbourhood transformation over time. We examine the spatiotemporal patterns of high-resolution changes of socioeconomic development and show how macro-level socioeconomic changes have reshaped neighbourhoods and altered the spatial structure of the metropolis.
