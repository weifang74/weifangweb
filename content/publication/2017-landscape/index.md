## 摘要

作为重要的城市和社区资产，公园为公共休闲、户外活动和居民社交提供了理想的开放空间。本研究采用基于高斯的2SFCA方法，通过两个门槛评估杭州41个分区的公园可达性，并突出了过去十年公园可达性变化的问题。本研究结果显示，2000年至2010年间提供了更多公园，研究区域内公园的可达性整体有所改善，且未发现不同社会经济群体在公园可及性变化方面的显著差异。然而，城市内部空间不平等已被识别出来。通过将公园通行性置于中国不同的文化和地理背景中，本研究丰富了当前的公平理论框架，将公平视为一个过程，将公平视为共时现象，并引入了评估当前政策或规划有效性的方法，适用于中国和美国其他城市.

## Abstract

As important city and community assets, parks provide ideal open spaces for public recreation, outdoor activities, and residents’ socialization. Using the Gaussian-based 2SFCA method, this study evaluates park accessibility by two thresholds across the 41 sub-districts in Hangzhou and highlights the issue of the changing accessibility of parks over the past decade. The results of this study show that more parks
were provided from 2000 to 2010, the accessibility of parks for the study area has improved overall, and significant differences among socioeconomic groups in terms of park access and changes in that access have not been detected. However, intra-urban spatial have been identified. By situating park access within different cultural and geographical contexts in China, this study enriches the current equity theory framework by introducing equity as a process and equity as a synchronic phenomenon, and introduces an effective approach to the evaluation of the validity of current policies or planning to other cities both in China and the United States.
