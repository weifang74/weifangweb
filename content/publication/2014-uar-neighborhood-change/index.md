abstract: "This study systematically examines neighborhood change trajectories at the census tract level across all U.S. metropolitan and micropolitan areas from 1990 to 2010. Using k-means cluster analysis and discriminant analysis, seven distinct neighborhood typologies are identified. The research reveals a primarily stable nature of neighborhoods, alongside a polarization of inequality. It highlights that many significant neighborhood changes do not fit neatly into traditional categories of downgrading or upgrading. Understanding these diverse and complex trajectories is crucial for policymakers and practitioners to effectively provide appropriate local services, support, and opportunities for residents."

summary: "本研究采用k-均值聚类分析和判别分析，系统考察了1990年至2010年美国所有大都市区和微型都市区内邻里变化的轨迹。通过聚类图和其他统计检验，识别出七种邻里类型。研究揭示了邻里性质主要保持稳定，同时伴随着不平等的两极分化。值得注意的是，许多重要的邻里变化并不属于传统的降级或升级范畴。理解这些多样化和复杂的轨迹对于政策制定者和实践者有效提供适当的本地服务、支持和机会至关重要。"

## 摘要

本研究采用k-均值聚类分析和判别分析，系统考察了1990年至2010年美国所有大都市区和微型都市区内邻里变化的轨迹。通过聚类图和其他统计检验，识别出七种邻里类型。研究揭示了邻里性质主要保持稳定，同时伴随着不平等的两极分化。值得注意的是，许多重要的邻里变化并不属于传统的降级或升级范畴。理解这些多样化和复杂的轨迹对于政策制定者和实践者有效提供适当的本地服务、支持和机会至关重要。

## Abstract

This study systematically examines neighborhood change trajectories at the census tract level across all U.S. metropolitan and micropolitan areas from 1990 to 2010. Using k-means cluster analysis and discriminant analysis, seven distinct neighborhood typologies are identified. The research reveals a primarily stable nature of neighborhoods, alongside a polarization of inequality. It highlights that many significant neighborhood changes do not fit neatly into traditional categories of downgrading or upgrading. Understanding these diverse and complex trajectories is crucial for policymakers and practitioners to effectively provide appropriate local services, support, and opportunities for residents.
