## 摘要

快速城市化过程引发的土地利用变化导致生境破碎,物种灭绝,并引发了一系列“城市生态病”。因此,城市生境质量的影响要素及测度评估研究对促进城市可持续发展和提升人类福祉具有重要意义。文章系统梳理了生态学和地理学领域的相关研究,总结了城市生境质量评估的8种方法,阐述了城市生境质量的影响因素和形成机制,为通过城市空间管控提升城市生境质量进而改善居民福祉提供依据。

## Abstract

Land-use changes caused by rapid urbanization lead to habitat fragmentation, species extinction, and a series of "urban ecological diseases". To promote sustainable development and human well-being, it is important to study the influence factors and evaluation methods on habitat quality. In this study, eight evaluation methods were summarized and the influence factors and mechanism of urban habitat quality were described. References for the improvement of urban habitat quality and human well-being in urban space control were provided.
