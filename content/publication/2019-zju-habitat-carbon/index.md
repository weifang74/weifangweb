## 摘要

城市发展面临用地扩张与生态环境保护之间的矛盾。为了在大尺度上定量化地识别生态重点保育空间进而确定城市开发边界,利用InVEST 模型的生境质量模块及碳储存和固持模块对杭州市域范围十区三县市内的生态系统服务进行量化评估。通过空间分析和数据信息分析反映生物多样性的生境质量和碳储量的双赢区域,通过模型参数设置的敏感性和结果的有效性分析确保分析的可靠性。研究结果表明,杭州市域各区县的生境质量以及碳储量水平存在较大的空间差异,生态服务水平总体呈现西南高东北低的态势。将生态系统服务评估纳入城市土地利用决策过程,确定基于生态系统服务的优先保护区域,为城市刚性开发边界的划定提供依据。

## Abstract

The contradiction between land expansion and ecological protection exists in decisions about urban development. In order to quantitatively identify the key ecological conservation area on a large scale and delineate a rigid urban growth boundary, habitat quality and carbon storage and sequestration modules in the InVEST model were used to quantitatively evaluate the ecosystem services over ten districts, one county-level city, and two counties in Hangzhou. Spatial and data information analyses were used to deal with the win-win areas of habitat quality (as a proxy of biodiversity) and carbon stocks, and the analyses of sensitivity of model parameter and the validity of the results were used to ensure the reliability of the analyses. Results show that spatial differences exist in the levels of habitat quality and carbon storage. Those areas in the southwest have higher levels of ecosystem service than those in the northeast. By integrating ecosystem service evaluation into the urban land use decision-making process, priority conservation areas were defined and references for the delineation of a rigid urban growth boundary were provided.
