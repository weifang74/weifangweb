## 摘要

过去几十年，中国快速城镇化伴随着生态恶化，对城市可持续性构成严重威胁。本研究旨在解决在划定城市增长边界时，生态系统服务（ES）评估在城市规划和保护优先排序中整合不足的问题。我们提出了一个以杭州为例的框架，利用InVEST模型对五种ES（栖息地质量、碳储量、产水量、泥沙截留、养分截留）进行建模和制图，并评估了它们之间的重叠。通过系统性保护规划工具Zonation，明确了空间上的保护优先区域。该分析框架定义了ES保护的优先区域并划定了刚性城市增长边界，将ES评估整合到城市土地利用决策过程中，并处理了保护优先排序决策中的权衡。

## Abstract

China's rapid urbanization over the past decades has led to significant ecological deterioration, threatening urban area sustainability. This study addresses the limited integration of ecosystem services (ES) into urban planning and conservation prioritization when delineating urban growth boundaries. We propose a framework using Hangzhou as a case study. Five ES (habitat quality, carbon storage, water yield, sediment retention, nutrient retention) were modeled and mapped using the InVEST model, and their overlaps were evaluated. Zonation, a systematic conservation planning tool, was applied to spatialize conservation prioritization. The analytical framework defines priority areas for ES conservation and delineates a rigid urban growth boundary, integrating ES evaluations into urban land-use decision-making and addressing compromises in conservation prioritization.
