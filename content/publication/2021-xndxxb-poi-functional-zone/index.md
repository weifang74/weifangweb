## 摘要

基于兴趣点数据(Point of Interest, POI)与城市分区相关理论,以重庆市核心城区为研究对象,在对POI进行筛选与分类的基础上,构建“空间——影响力”二元权重计算模型以量化 POI 属性,在精细化网格尺度下对功能混合度进行计算,并结合街道分区识别各街区主体功能。结果表明:中心城区整体功能混合程度较高,功能分区识别以多中心为显著特征,城市组团发展模式较成熟;不同类型 POI 所属功能区空间分布差异化明显,商服、居住、公服等功能以组团分布、圈层围合为整体特征,工业功能主要以中心城区边缘化分布为主,交通、绿地功能分别以主要站场和大型公园为主;基于POI的功能区识别效果显著,小尺度网格的功能混合度对山地城市的土地利用描述具有一定的参考价值。

## Abstract

Based on the theory of urban zoning and POI (point of interest)data, this paper takes the core urban area of Chongqing as an example, and based on the screening and classification of POI data, a “space-influence” binary weight calculation model is constructed to quantify POI attributes. Combined with the street partition, the main functions of each block are identified, and the functional mixture is calculated at the refined grid scale. The results indicate that the overall function of the central urban area is highly mixed, and the functional partition recognition is characterized by multi-center, and the urban group development mode is relatively mature; that the spatial distribution of functional areas of POIs with different functions is obviously different, and the functions of commercial service, residence and public service are characterized by group distribution and circle enclosing, while the industrial functions are mainly distributed around the central urban area, and the traffic and green space functions are mainly distributed in stations and large parks; and that the function recognition based on POI is significant, and the blending measure of refined grid has certain reference value for land use description of mountainous cities.
