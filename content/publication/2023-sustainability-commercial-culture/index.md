abstract: "This study investigates the role of commercial culture in shaping and transforming the urban structure of Hangzhou, China, a multi-identity city. Through a diachronic analysis of classical texts, historical maps, and POI data, the research identifies commercial culture as the primary driver, rather than political or economic factors. The study distinguishes three major transformations in Hangzhou's urban spatial structure over the last 900 years. Each transformation was fueled by a complex interplay of commercial culture with other elements like civil, leisure, landscape, and industrial cultures. Urban heritages were formed, preserved, and revitalized during these transformations, further enriching commercial culture and reshaping the city's structure. This research offers a continuous, diachronic perspective on urban transformation, highlighting the dynamic interplay of commercial forces and urban development."

summary: "本研究调查了商业文化在塑造和转型中国多重身份城市杭州的城市结构中所起的作用。通过对古代文献、历史地图和POI数据的历时性分析，研究确定商业文化是主要驱动力，而非政治或经济因素。研究区分了杭州近900年来的三次城市空间结构的主要转型。每一次转型都由商业文化与其他文化（如市民文化、休闲文化、景观文化和工业文化）的复杂互动所驱动。在转型过程中，城市遗产得以形成、保存和活化，进一步丰富了商业文化，并重塑了城市的结构。本研究提供了一个连续的、历时的城市转型视角，突出了商业力量与城市发展的动态互动。"

## 摘要

本研究调查了商业文化在塑造和转型中国多重身份城市杭州的城市结构中所起的作用。通过对古代文献、历史地图和POI数据的历时性分析，研究确定商业文化是主要驱动力，而非政治或经济因素。研究区分了杭州近900年来的三次城市空间结构的主要转型。每一次转型都由商业文化与其他文化（如市民文化、休闲文化、景观文化和工业文化）的复杂互动所驱动。在转型过程中，城市遗产得以形成、保存和活化，进一步丰富了商业文化，并重塑了城市的结构。本研究提供了一个连续的、历时的城市转型视角，突出了商业力量与城市发展的动态互动。

## Abstract

This study investigates the role of commercial culture in shaping and transforming the urban structure of Hangzhou, China, a multi-identity city. Through a diachronic analysis of classical texts, historical maps, and POI data, the research identifies commercial culture as the primary driver, rather than political or economic factors. The study distinguishes three major transformations in Hangzhou's urban spatial structure over the last 900 years. Each transformation was fueled by a complex interplay of commercial culture with other elements like civil, leisure, landscape, and industrial cultures. Urban heritages were formed, preserved, and revitalized during these transformations, further enriching commercial culture and reshaping the city's structure. This research offers a continuous, diachronic perspective on urban transformation, highlighting the dynamic interplay of commercial forces and urban development.
