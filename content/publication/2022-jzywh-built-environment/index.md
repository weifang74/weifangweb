abstract: "The built environment has a positive or negative impact on physical activity and public health. There is a lot of research on the relationship between the built environment and physical activity in the fields of urban planning, public health and transportation. However, the complexity of the relationship and the application of research results still need to be further explored. Based on the two dimensions of the impact of the built environment on physical activity and the application of research results, this paper analyzes the complexity of the relationship and discusses the approaches to translate research results into public policy and evidence-based design guidelines for healthy city planning. It could inform spatial planners and decision-makers in building a healthy human settlement."

summary: "建成环境会对体力活动水平和公共健康产生积极或消极影响。城市规划、公共卫生、交通等领域对建成环境与体力活动关系研究颇丰,但对于二者关系的复杂性及研究成果应用还亟待深入研究。基于建成环境要素对体力活动的影响和研究结果应用两个维度,文章分析了二者关系的复杂性,探讨了研究成果转化为公共政策和健康城市循证设计指南的实现方法。以期为构建健康人居环境的空间规划与决策提供借鉴。"

## 摘要

建成环境会对体力活动水平和公共健康产生积极或消极影响。城市规划、公共卫生、交通等领域对建成环境与体力活动关系研究颇丰,但对于二者关系的复杂性及研究成果应用还亟待深入研究。基于建成环境要素对体力活动的影响和研究结果应用两个维度,文章分析了二者关系的复杂性,探讨了研究成果转化为公共政策和健康城市循证设计指南的实现方法。以期为构建健康人居环境的空间规划与决策提供借鉴。

## Abstract

The built environment has a positive or negative impact on physical activity and public health. There is a lot of research on the relationship between the built environment and physical activity in the fields of urban planning, public health and transportation. However, the complexity of the relationship and the application of research results still need to be further explored. Based on the two dimensions of the impact of the built environment on physical activity and the application of research results, this paper analyzes the complexity of the relationship and discusses the approaches to translate research results into public policy and evidence-based design guidelines for healthy city planning. It could inform spatial planners and decision-makers in building a healthy human settlement.
